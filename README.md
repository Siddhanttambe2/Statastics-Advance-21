# Statistical Analysis README

This repository contains Python code for performing various statistical tests, including the F-test, one-way ANOVA, and other related analyses. Below is a summary of each task and its respective Python implementation.

---

### 1. **Properties of the F-distribution**

The **F-distribution** is used primarily in the context of variance comparison, hypothesis testing, and regression analysis. Its key properties include:
- It is **non-negative** and **right-skewed**.
- It depends on two degrees of freedom: numerator and denominator.
- The **mean** of the distribution is \( \frac{d_2}{d_2 - 2} \), and the **variance** is given by \( \frac{2(d_2)^2(d_1 + d_2 - 2)}{d_1(d_2 - 2)^2(d_2 - 4)} \).
- It is commonly used in **ANOVA** and comparing **variances**.

---

### 2. **Types of Statistical Tests Using the F-distribution**

The **F-distribution** is used in the following tests:
- **ANOVA**: To compare the means of three or more groups by testing the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance.
- **Regression Analysis**: To test the overall significance of regression models.
- **Comparing Variances**: Used to compare the variances of two populations using an F-test.
  
The F-distribution is appropriate because it compares variances, helping to detect whether observed differences between groups are statistically significant.

---

### 3. **Key Assumptions for an F-test**

For a valid **F-test** comparing variances, the following assumptions must hold:
- **Normality**: Populations must follow a normal distribution.
- **Independence**: Observations must be independent of each other.
- **Random Sampling**: Samples should be randomly selected.
- **Ratio of Variances**: The ratio of variances under the null hypothesis should be fixed.

Violation of these assumptions may lead to inaccurate results, and alternative tests (e.g., Levene's test) should be considered.

---

### 4. **ANOVA vs. T-test**

- **ANOVA** is used when comparing **three or more groups** to test if there are significant differences between their means.
- **T-test** is used for comparing **two groups**.
  
ANOVA is preferred over multiple t-tests for efficiency and to control for Type I errors that arise when conducting several t-tests.

---

### 5. **One-way ANOVA vs. Multiple T-tests**

- **One-way ANOVA** is preferred over multiple t-tests when comparing more than two groups to prevent inflating the Type I error rate. It tests all groups simultaneously and provides a single F-statistic.
- **Multiple t-tests** would increase the likelihood of a Type I error because each test has its own risk of false positives.

---

### 6. **Partitioning Variance in ANOVA**

In **ANOVA**, total variance is partitioned into two components:
- **Between-group variance**: Variance due to differences between group means.
- **Within-group variance**: Variance within each group due to random error.

The **F-statistic** is the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance. A higher F-statistic indicates that group means are significantly different.

---

### 7. **Classical vs. Bayesian ANOVA**

- **Classical (Frequentist) ANOVA**: Uses p-values and confidence intervals to test hypotheses based on the likelihood of observing the data under the null hypothesis.
- **Bayesian ANOVA**: Uses prior distributions and updates them with data to compute posterior distributions. It provides a more flexible approach by giving probability estimates for hypotheses rather than relying solely on p-values.

---

### 8. **F-test for Comparing Variances**

Given the incomes for two professions, we performed an **F-test** to compare their variances:
- **Profession A**: [48, 52, 55, 60, 62]
- **Profession B**: [45, 50, 55, 52, 47]

The calculated **F-statistic** was 2.089, and the **p-value** was 0.247, indicating that the variances of the two professions' incomes are **not significantly different** (p-value > 0.05).

---

### 9. **One-way ANOVA for Comparing Heights Across Regions**

For comparing the average heights in three regions:
- **Region A**: [160, 162, 165, 158, 164]
- **Region B**: [172, 175, 170, 168, 174]
- **Region C**: [180, 182, 179, 185, 183]

The **F-statistic** was 67.87, and the **p-value** was 2.87 × 10⁻⁷, indicating **statistically significant differences** in the average heights across the three regions (p-value < 0.05).

### Conclusion

This project demonstrates how to perform various statistical tests using Python, including the F-test and one-way ANOVA, to compare variances and means across multiple groups. The results can help draw conclusions about differences between groups, with an emphasis on correctly interpreting the F-statistic and p-values.
